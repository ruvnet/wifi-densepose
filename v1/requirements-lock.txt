# WiFi-DensePose Pipeline Verification - Pinned Dependencies
# These versions are locked to ensure deterministic pipeline output.
# The proof bundle (v1/data/proof/) depends on exact numerical behavior
# from these libraries. Changing versions may alter floating-point results
# and require regenerating the expected hash.
#
# To update: change versions, run `python v1/data/proof/verify.py --generate-hash`,
# then commit the new expected_features.sha256.
