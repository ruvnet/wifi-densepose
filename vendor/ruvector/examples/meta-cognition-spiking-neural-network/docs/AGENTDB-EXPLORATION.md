## 🔬 Technical Discoveries

### RuVector API

**Correct Usage**:
```javascript
const db = new VectorDB({
  dimensions: 128,
  maxElements: 1000,
  storagePath: '/absolute/path/to/db.bin' // Absolute paths required
});

// Insert
await db.insert({
  id: 'doc1',
  vector: new Float32Array(128),
  metadata: { title: 'Example' }
});

// Search
const results = await db.search({
  vector: queryVector,
  k: 5
});

// Results structure: { id, score }
// Metadata not returned in search results
```

### Attention Mechanisms API

**Correct Usage**:
```javascript
const { MultiHeadAttention, HyperbolicAttention, FlashAttention } =
  require('@ruvector/attention');

// Multi-Head
const mha = new MultiHeadAttention(dim, numHeads);
const output = mha.compute(query, keys, values);

// Hyperbolic (curvature must be negative)
const hyp = new HyperbolicAttention(dim, -1.0);

// Flash (blockSize parameter)
const flash = new FlashAttention(dim, blockSize);
```
