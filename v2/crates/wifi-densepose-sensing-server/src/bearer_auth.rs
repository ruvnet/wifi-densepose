//! Opt-in bearer-token auth for the sensing-server HTTP API (#443).
//!
//! When the `RUVIEW_API_TOKEN` environment variable is set, every request
//! whose path begins with `/api/v1/` must carry a matching
//! `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, otherwise the server responds with
//! `401 Unauthorized`. When the env var is unset (or empty), the middleware is
//! a no-op and the API stays unauthenticated — preserving the long-standing
//! LAN-only deployment posture documented in the issue. This is a binary,
//! deployment-time switch with **no default authentication change**.
//!
//! Endpoints outside `/api/v1/*` (`/health*`, `/ws/sensing`, the static `/ui/*`
//! mount, `/`) are intentionally **not** gated:
//! * `/health*` is the liveness/readiness probe that orchestrators hit
//!   anonymously;
//! * `/ws/sensing` and `/ui/*` are served to local browsers that can't easily
//!   inject headers — the sensitive control plane is the `/api/v1/*` tree, and
//!   that is what this layer protects.
//!
//! The header check uses a length-then-byte constant-time compare to avoid
//! leaking the token through timing.
//!
//! # Cognitum OAuth (ADR-271)
//!
//! A second, **additive** credential is supported: a Cognitum OAuth access
//! token, verified offline against `auth.cognitum.one`'s published JWKS. It is
//! enabled by setting [`OAUTH_ISSUER_ENV`], and the two schemes layer:
//!
//! 1. If `RUVIEW_API_TOKEN` is set and the presented bearer matches it exactly,
//!    the request is allowed — byte-for-byte today's behaviour.
//! 2. Otherwise, if OAuth is configured, the bearer is verified as a JWT and
//!    must carry the scope the route requires.
//! 3. Otherwise `401`.
//!
//! Order matters for compatibility, not for security: a static token that
//! matches is not a JWT, and a JWT never matches the static token. Trying the
//! static compare first means an existing deployment's behaviour is unchanged
//! even with OAuth switched on.
//!
//! **Nothing here weakens the unset case.** With neither variable set the
//! middleware is the same no-op it has always been.
//!
//! ## Scope gating
//!
//! Not every route carries the same blast radius, so a single "authenticated"
//! bit is too coarse once we have scopes. [`required_scope_for`] maps a request
//! to `sensing:read` or `sensing:admin` — see its docs for the split and why it
//! is drawn where it is.
