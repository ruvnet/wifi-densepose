//! Cognitum OAuth access-token verification (ADR-271).
//!
//! The accept-rule is ported from `meta-llm/src/auth/oauthBearer.ts` (ADR-045),
//! the only other resource-server-side verifier of these tokens in the org.
//! Divergence from it would be a bug, not a preference — a token meta-llm
//! rejects must not be one RuView accepts.
//!
//! ## The trust chain, narrowly
//!
//! 1. Only identity's ES256 key — fetched from the published JWKS by `kid` —
//!    can sign an accepted token. No shared secret, no static PEM to leak.
//! 2. **The algorithm is fixed to ES256 by this code.** The token header's `alg`
//!    is only ever *compared against* that allowlist, never used to *select* an
//!    algorithm. That is what makes `alg: none` and RSA-substitution
//!    non-starters rather than things we defend against case by case.
//! 3. Signature math is `jsonwebtoken`'s. This module owns claim policy only.
//!
//! ## Why `setup` and `workload` tokens are refused outright
//!
//! Identity also issues long-lived *setup* (365-day) and *workload* credentials.
//! Their revocation lives in identity's `oauth_setup_tokens` table, and RuView —
//! like meta-llm — has **no database and no way to check it**. A 15-minute
//! access token needs no revocation round-trip because it expires faster than
//! any realistic revocation propagates; a 365-day one does. Accepting one would
//! mean honouring a credential that may already have been revoked, so we don't.
//!
//! ## There is no `aud` claim, and no `iss` claim either
//!
//! Verified against real production tokens: the claim set is exactly
//! `typ, sub, account_id, org_id, workspace_id, client_id, scope, family_id,
//! jti, iat, exp, setup, workload`. No audience. No issuer.
//!
//! **What binds a token to its issuer, then?** The JWKS. We accept only
//! signatures made by a key served from the configured `jwks_uri`, so
//! possession of a valid signature *is* proof of issuer. Adding an `iss` claim
//! check on top would not strengthen that — and requiring a claim identity does
//! not emit rejects every genuine token, which is exactly what an earlier
//! revision of this module did.
//!
//! **`client_id` is Cognitum's stand-in for `aud`.** `cognitum-one/freetokens`
//! (live) documents the contract — *"Cognitum access tokens intentionally use
//! custom `client_id` rather than a registered JWT `aud` claim"* — and rejects
//! any token whose `client_id` is not its own. This verifier does the same via
//! [`VerifierConfig::allowed_client_ids`].
//!
//! An earlier revision treated `client_id` as unusable because clients borrow
//! each other's registrations (musica shipped as `meta-proxy` while its own was
//! pending) and relied on scope alone. That was reasoning from a transitional
//! state: RuView has its own registered client, and accepting a token minted for
//! any Cognitum product is a weaker position than the platform intends.
//!
//! So there are now TWO boundaries, not one: audience (`client_id`) and
//! capability (`scope`). Neither is optional garnish.
