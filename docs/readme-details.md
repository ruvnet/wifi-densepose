## Latest Additions

### Real-Time Dense Point Cloud (NEW)

RuView now generates **real-time 3D point clouds** by fusing camera depth + WiFi CSI + mmWave radar. All sensors stream simultaneously into a unified spatial model.

| Sensor | Data | Integration |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Camera** | MiDaS monocular depth (GPU) | 640×480 → 19,200+ depth points per frame |
| **ESP32 CSI** | ADR-018 binary frames (UDP) | RF tomography → 8×8×4 occupancy grid |
| **WiFlow Pose** | 17 COCO keypoints from CSI | Skeleton overlay on point cloud |
| **Vital Signs** | Breathing rate from CSI phase | Stored in ruOS brain every 60s |
| **Motion** | CSI amplitude variance | Adaptive capture rate (skip depth when still) |

**Quick start:**
```bash
cd v2
cargo build --release -p wifi-densepose-pointcloud
./target/release/ruview-pointcloud serve --bind 127.0.0.1:9880
# Open http://localhost:9880 for live 3D viewer
```

**CLI commands:**
```bash
ruview-pointcloud demo                            # synthetic demo
ruview-pointcloud serve --bind 127.0.0.1:9880     # live server + Three.js viewer
ruview-pointcloud capture --output room.ply       # capture to PLY
ruview-pointcloud train                           # depth calibration + DPO pairs
ruview-pointcloud cameras                         # list available cameras
ruview-pointcloud csi-test --count 100            # send test CSI frames
ruview-pointcloud fingerprint office --seconds 5  # record named CSI room fingerprint
```

The HTTP/viewer server defaults to **loopback (`127.0.0.1`)** — exposing live camera/CSI/vitals on `0.0.0.0` is an explicit opt-in. Brain URL defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:9876` and is overridable via `RUVIEW_BRAIN_URL` env var or the `--brain` flag on `serve`/`train`.

The pose overlay currently uses an **amplitude-energy heuristic** (`heuristic_pose_from_amplitude`) rather than trained WiFlow inference — real ONNX/Candle inference is tracked as a follow-up.

**Performance:** 22ms pipeline, 905 req/s API, 40K voxel room model from 20 frames.

**Brain integration:** Spatial observations (motion, vitals, skeleton, occupancy) sync to the ruOS brain every 60 seconds for agent reasoning.

See [PR #405](https://github.com/ruvnet/RuView/pull/405) for full details.

### What's New in v0.7.0

<details>
<summary><strong>Camera Ground-Truth Training — 92.9% PCK@20</strong></summary>

**v0.7.0 adds camera-supervised pose training** using MediaPipe + real ESP32 CSI data:

| Capability | What it does | ADR |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| **Camera ground-truth collection** | MediaPipe PoseLandmarker captures 17 COCO keypoints at 30fps, synced with ESP32 CSI | [ADR-079](docs/adr/ADR-079-camera-ground-truth-training.md) |
| **ruvector subcarrier selection** | Variance-based top-K reduces input by 50% (70→35 subcarriers) | ADR-079 O6 |
| **Stoer-Wagner min-cut** | Person-specific subcarrier cluster separation for multi-person training | ADR-079 O8 |
| **Scalable WiFlow model** | 4 presets: lite (189K) → small (474K) → medium (800K) → full (7.7M params) | ADR-079 |

```bash
# Collect ground truth (camera + ESP32 simultaneously)
python scripts/collect-ground-truth.py --duration 300 --preview
python scripts/record-csi-udp.py --duration 300

# Align CSI windows with camera keypoints
node scripts/align-ground-truth.js --gt data/ground-truth/*.jsonl --csi data/recordings/*.csi.jsonl

# Train WiFlow model (start lite, scale up as data grows)
node scripts/train-wiflow-supervised.js --data data/paired/*.jsonl --scale lite

# Evaluate
node scripts/eval-wiflow.js --model models/wiflow-real/wiflow-v1.json --data data/paired/*.jsonl
```

**Result: 92.9% PCK@20** from a 5-minute data collection session with one ESP32-S3 and one webcam.

| Metric | Before (proxy) | After (camera-supervised) |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
| PCK@20 | 0% | **92.9%** |
| Eval loss | 0.700 | **0.082** |
| Bone constraint | N/A | **0.008** |
| Training time | N/A | **19 minutes** |
| Model size | N/A | **974 KB** |

## 🚀 Key Features

### Sensing

See people, breathing, and heartbeats through walls — using only WiFi signals already in the room.

| | Feature | What It Means |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 🔒 | **Privacy-First** | Tracks human pose using only WiFi signals — no cameras, no video, no images stored |
| 💓 | **Vital Signs** | Detects breathing rate (6-30 breaths/min) and heart rate (40-120 bpm) without any wearable |
| 👥 | **Multi-Person** | Tracks multiple people simultaneously, each with independent pose and vitals — no hard software limit (physics: ~3-5 per AP with 56 subcarriers, more with multi-AP) |
| 🧱 | **Through-Wall** | WiFi passes through walls, furniture, and debris — works where cameras cannot |
| 🚑 | **Disaster Response** | Detects trapped survivors through rubble and classifies injury severity (START triage) |
| 📡 | **Multistatic Mesh** | 4-6 low-cost sensor nodes work together, combining 12+ overlapping signal paths for full 360-degree room coverage with sub-inch accuracy and no person mix-ups ([ADR-029](docs/adr/ADR-029-ruvsense-multistatic-sensing-mode.md)) |
| 🌐 | **Persistent Field Model** | The system learns the RF signature of each room — then subtracts the room to isolate human motion, detect drift over days, predict intent before movement starts, and flag spoofing attempts ([ADR-030](docs/adr/ADR-030-ruvsense-persistent-field-model.md)) |

### Intelligence

The system learns on its own and gets smarter over time — no hand-tuning, no labeled data required.

| | Feature | What It Means |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 🧠 | **Self-Learning** | Teaches itself from raw WiFi data — no labeled training sets, no cameras needed to bootstrap ([ADR-024](docs/adr/ADR-024-contrastive-csi-embedding-model.md)) |
| 🎯 | **AI Signal Processing** | Attention networks, graph algorithms, and smart compression replace hand-tuned thresholds — adapts to each room automatically ([RuVector](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector)) |
| 🌍 | **Works Everywhere** | Train once, deploy in any room — adversarial domain generalization strips environment bias so models transfer across rooms, buildings, and hardware ([ADR-027](docs/adr/ADR-027-cross-environment-domain-generalization.md)) |
| 👁️ | **Cross-Viewpoint Fusion** | AI combines what each sensor sees from its own angle — fills in blind spots and depth ambiguity that no single viewpoint can resolve on its own ([ADR-031](docs/adr/ADR-031-ruview-sensing-first-rf-mode.md)) |
| 🔮 | **Signal-Line Protocol** | A 6-stage processing pipeline transforms raw WiFi signals into structured body representations — from signal cleanup through graph-based spatial reasoning to final pose output ([ADR-033](docs/adr/ADR-033-crv-signal-line-sensing-integration.md)) |
| 🔒 | **QUIC Mesh Security** | All sensor-to-sensor communication is encrypted end-to-end with tamper detection, replay protection, and seamless reconnection if a node moves or drops offline ([ADR-032](docs/adr/ADR-032-multistatic-mesh-security-hardening.md)) |
| 🎯 | **Adaptive Classifier** | Records labeled CSI sessions, trains a 15-feature logistic regression model in pure Rust, and learns your room's unique signal characteristics — replaces hand-tuned thresholds with data-driven classification ([ADR-048](docs/adr/ADR-048-adaptive-csi-classifier.md)) |

### Performance & Deployment

Fast enough for real-time use, small enough for edge devices, simple enough for one-command setup.

| | Feature | What It Means |
|---|---------|---------------|
| ⚡ | **Real-Time** | Analyzes WiFi signals in under 100 microseconds per frame — fast enough for live monitoring |
| 🦀 | **810x Faster** | Complete Rust rewrite: 54,000 frames/sec pipeline, multi-arch Docker image, 1,031+ tests |
| 🐳 | **One-Command Setup** | `docker pull ruvnet/wifi-densepose:latest` — live sensing in 30 seconds, no toolchain needed (amd64 + arm64 / Apple Silicon) |
| 📡 | **Fully Local** | Runs completely on a $9 ESP32 — no internet connection, no cloud account, no recurring fees. Detects presence, vital signs, and falls on-device with instant response |
| 📦 | **Portable Models** | Trained models package into a single `.rvf` file — runs on edge, cloud, or browser (WASM) |
| 🔭 | **Observatory Visualization** | Cinematic Three.js dashboard with 5 holographic panels — subcarrier manifold, vital signs oracle, presence heatmap, phase constellation, convergence engine — all driven by live or demo CSI data ([ADR-047](docs/adr/ADR-047-psychohistory-observatory-visualization.md)) |
| 📟 | **AMOLED Display** | ESP32-S3 boards with built-in AMOLED screens show real-time presence, vital signs, and room status directly on the sensor — no phone or PC needed ([ADR-045](docs/adr/ADR-045-amoled-display-support.md)) |

<summary><strong>📡 Signal Processing & Sensing</strong> — From raw WiFi frames to vital signs</summary>

The signal processing stack transforms raw WiFi Channel State Information into actionable human sensing data. Starting from 56-192 subcarrier complex values captured at 20 Hz, the pipeline applies research-grade algorithms (SpotFi phase correction, Hampel outlier rejection, Fresnel zone modeling) to extract breathing rate, heart rate, motion level, and multi-person body pose — all in pure Rust with zero external ML dependencies.

<summary><strong>🧠 Models & Training</strong> — DensePose pipeline, RVF containers, SONA adaptation, RuVector integration</summary>

The neural pipeline uses a graph transformer with cross-attention to map CSI feature matrices to 17 COCO body keypoints and DensePose UV coordinates. Models are packaged as single-file `.rvf` containers with progressive loading (Layer A instant, Layer B warm, Layer C full). SONA (Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture) enables continuous on-device adaptation via micro-LoRA + EWC++ without catastrophic forgetting. Signal processing is powered by 5 [RuVector](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector) crates (v2.0.4) with 7 integration points across the Rust workspace, plus 6 additional vendored crates for inference and graph intelligence.

<summary><strong>🌍 Cross-Environment Generalization (ADR-027 — Project MERIDIAN)</strong> — Train once, deploy in any room without retraining</summary>

| What | How it works | Why it matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Gradient Reversal Layer** | An adversarial classifier tries to guess which room the signal came from; the main network is trained to fool it | Forces the model to discard room-specific shortcuts |
| **Geometry Encoder (FiLM)** | Transmitter/receiver positions are Fourier-encoded and injected as scale+shift conditioning on every layer | The model knows *where* the hardware is, so it doesn't need to memorize layout |
| **Hardware Normalizer** | Resamples any chipset's CSI to a canonical 56-subcarrier format with standardized amplitude | Intel 5300 and ESP32 data look identical to the model |
| **Virtual Domain Augmentation** | Generates synthetic environments with random room scale, wall reflections, scatterers, and noise profiles | Training sees 1000s of rooms even with data from just 2-3 |
| **Rapid Adaptation (TTT)** | Contrastive test-time training with LoRA weight generation from a few unlabeled frames | Zero-shot deployment — the model self-tunes on arrival |
| **Cross-Domain Evaluator** | Leave-one-out evaluation across all training environments with per-environment PCK/OKS metrics | Proves generalization, not just memorization |

**Architecture**

```
CSI Frame [any chipset]
    │
    ▼
HardwareNormalizer ──→ canonical 56 subcarriers, N(0,1) amplitude
    │
    ▼
CSI Encoder (existing) ──→ latent features
    │
    ├──→ Pose Head ──→ 17-joint pose (environment-invariant)
    │
    ├──→ Gradient Reversal Layer ──→ Domain Classifier (adversarial)
    │         λ ramps 0→1 via cosine/exponential schedule
    │
    └──→ Geometry Encoder ──→ FiLM conditioning (scale + shift)
              Fourier positional encoding → DeepSets → per-layer modulation
```

**Security hardening:**
- Bounded calibration buffer (max 10,000 frames) prevents memory exhaustion
- `adapt()` returns `Result<_, AdaptError>` — no panics on bad input
- Atomic instance counter ensures unique weight initialization across threads
- Division-by-zero guards on all augmentation parameters

<summary><strong>📡 Multistatic Sensing (ADR-029/030/031 — Project RuvSense + RuView)</strong> — Multiple ESP32 nodes fuse viewpoints for production-grade pose, tracking, and exotic sensing</summary>

A single WiFi receiver can track people, but has blind spots — limbs behind the torso are invisible, depth is ambiguous, and two people at similar range create overlapping signals. RuvSense solves this by coordinating multiple ESP32 nodes into a **multistatic mesh** where every node acts as both transmitter and receiver, creating N×(N-1) measurement links from N devices.

**What it does in plain terms:**
- 4 ESP32-S3 nodes ($48 total) provide 12 TX-RX measurement links covering 360 degrees
- Each node hops across WiFi channels 1/6/11, tripling effective bandwidth from 20→60 MHz
- Coherence gating rejects noisy frames automatically — no manual tuning, stable for days
- Two-person tracking at 20 Hz with zero identity swaps over 10 minutes
- The room itself becomes a persistent model — the system remembers, predicts, and explains

**Three ADRs, one pipeline:**

| ADR | Codename | What it adds |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| [ADR-029](docs/adr/ADR-029-ruvsense-multistatic-sensing-mode.md) | **RuvSense** | Channel hopping, TDM protocol, multi-node fusion, coherence gating, 17-keypoint Kalman tracker |

<summary><b>🔮 Signal-Line Protocol (CRV)</b></summary>

### 6-Stage CSI Signal Line

Maps the CRV (Coordinate Remote Viewing) signal-line methodology to WiFi CSI processing via `ruvector-crv`:

| Stage | CRV Name | WiFi CSI Mapping | ruvector Component |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| I | Ideograms | Raw CSI gestalt (manmade/natural/movement/energy) | Poincare ball hyperbolic embeddings |
| II | Sensory | Amplitude textures, phase patterns, frequency colors | Multi-head attention vectors |
| III | Dimensional | AP mesh spatial topology, node geometry | GNN graph topology |
| IV | Emotional/AOL | Coherence gating — signal vs noise separation | SNN temporal encoding |
| V | Interrogation | Cross-stage probing — query pose against CSI history | Differentiable search |
| VI | 3D Model | Composite person estimation, MinCut partitioning | Graph partitioning |

**Cross-Session Convergence**: When multiple AP clusters observe the same person, CRV convergence analysis finds agreement in their signal embeddings — directly mapping to cross-room identity continuity.

```rust
use wifi_densepose_ruvector::crv::WifiCrvPipeline;

let mut pipeline = WifiCrvPipeline::new(WifiCrvConfig::default());
pipeline.create_session("room-a", "person-001")?;

// Process CSI frames through 6-stage pipeline
let result = pipeline.process_csi_frame("room-a", &amplitudes, &phases)?;
// result.gestalt = Movement, confidence = 0.87
// result.sensory_embedding = [0.12, -0.34, ...]

// Cross-room identity matching via convergence
let convergence = pipeline.find_cross_room_convergence("person-001", 0.75)?;
```

**Architecture**:
- `CsiGestaltClassifier` — Maps CSI amplitude/phase patterns to 6 gestalt types
- `CsiSensoryEncoder` — Extracts texture/color/temperature/luminosity features from subcarriers
- `MeshTopologyEncoder` — Encodes AP mesh as GNN graph (Stage III)
- `CoherenceAolDetector` — Maps coherence gate states to AOL noise detection (Stage IV)
- `WifiCrvPipeline` — Orchestrates all 6 stages into unified sensing session

A single ESP32-S3 board (~$9) captures WiFi signal data 28 times per second and streams it over UDP. A host server can visualize and record the data, but the ESP32 can also run on its own — detecting presence, measuring breathing and heart rate, and alerting on falls without any server at all.

```bash
# 1. Flash the firmware to your ESP32-S3 (8MB flash — most boards)
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 --port COM7 --baud 460800 \
  write_flash --flash-mode dio --flash-size 8MB --flash-freq 80m \
  0x0 bootloader.bin 0x8000 partition-table.bin \
  0xf000 ota_data_initial.bin 0x20000 esp32-csi-node.bin

# 1b. For 4MB flash boards (e.g. ESP32-S3 SuperMini 4MB) — use the 4MB binaries:
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 --port COM7 --baud 460800 \
  write_flash --flash-mode dio --flash-size 4MB --flash-freq 80m \
  0x0 bootloader.bin 0x8000 partition-table-4mb.bin \
  0xF000 ota_data_initial.bin 0x20000 esp32-csi-node-4mb.bin

# 2. Set WiFi credentials and server address (stored in flash, survives reboots)
python firmware/esp32-csi-node/provision.py --port COM7 \
  --ssid "YourWiFi" --password "secret" --target-ip 192.168.1.20

# 3. (Optional) Start the host server to visualize data
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --http-port 3000 --source auto
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Multi-node mesh

For better accuracy and room coverage, deploy 3-6 nodes with time-division multiplexing (TDM) so they take turns transmitting:

```bash
# Node 0 of a 3-node mesh
python firmware/esp32-csi-node/provision.py --port COM7 \
  --ssid "YourWiFi" --password "secret" --target-ip 192.168.1.20 \
  --node-id 0 --tdm-slot 0 --tdm-total 3

# Node 1
python firmware/esp32-csi-node/provision.py --port COM8 \
  --ssid "YourWiFi" --password "secret" --target-ip 192.168.1.20 \
  --node-id 1 --tdm-slot 1 --tdm-total 3
```

Nodes can also hop across WiFi channels (1, 6, 11) to increase sensing bandwidth — configured via [ADR-029](docs/adr/ADR-029-ruvsense-multistatic-sensing-mode.md) channel hopping.

### Cognitum Seed integration (ADR-069)

Connect an ESP32 to a [Cognitum Seed](https://cognitum.one) ($131) for persistent vector storage, kNN search, cryptographic witness chain, and AI-accessible MCP proxy:

```
ESP32-S3 ($9)  ──UDP──>  Host bridge  ──HTTPS──>  Cognitum Seed ($15)
  CSI capture              seed_csi_bridge.py         RVF vector store
  8-dim features @ 1 Hz                              kNN similarity search
  Vitals + presence                                  Ed25519 witness chain
                                                     114-tool MCP proxy
```

```bash
# 1. Provision ESP32 to send features to your laptop
python firmware/esp32-csi-node/provision.py --port COM9 \
  --ssid "YourWiFi" --password "secret" --target-ip 192.168.1.20 --target-port 5006

# 2. Run the bridge (forwards to Seed via HTTPS)
export SEED_TOKEN="your-pairing-token"
python scripts/seed_csi_bridge.py \
  --seed-url https://169.254.42.1:8443 --token "$SEED_TOKEN" --validate

# 3. Check Seed stats
python scripts/seed_csi_bridge.py --token "$SEED_TOKEN" --stats
```

The 8-dim feature vector captures: presence, motion, breathing rate, heart rate, phase variance, person count, fall detection, and RSSI — all normalized to [0.0, 1.0]. See [ADR-069](docs/adr/ADR-069-cognitum-seed-csi-pipeline.md) for the full architecture.

### On-device intelligence (v0.3.0-alpha)

The alpha firmware can analyze signals locally and send compact results instead of raw data. This means the ESP32 works standalone — no server needed for basic sensing. Disabled by default for backward compatibility.

| Tier | What it does | RAM used |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **0** | Off — streams raw CSI only (same as v0.2.0) | 0 KB |
| **1** | Cleans up signals, picks the best subcarriers, compresses data (saves 30-50% bandwidth) | ~30 KB |
| **2** | Everything in Tier 1 + detects presence, measures breathing and heart rate, detects falls | ~33 KB |
| **3** | Everything in Tier 2 + runs custom WASM modules (gesture recognition, intrusion detection, and [63 more](docs/edge-modules/README.md)) | ~160 KB/module |

Enable without reflashing — just reprovision:

```bash
# Turn on Tier 2 (vitals) on an already-flashed node
python firmware/esp32-csi-node/provision.py --port COM7 \
  --ssid "YourWiFi" --password "secret" --target-ip 192.168.1.20 \
  --edge-tier 2

# Fine-tune detection thresholds (fall-thresh in milli-units: 15000 = 15.0 rad/s²)
python firmware/esp32-csi-node/provision.py --port COM7 \
  --edge-tier 2 --vital-int 500 --fall-thresh 15000 --subk-count 16
```

When Tier 2 is active, the node sends a 32-byte vitals packet once per second containing: presence, motion level, breathing BPM, heart rate BPM, confidence scores, fall alert flag, and occupancy count.

See [firmware/esp32-csi-node/README.md](firmware/esp32-csi-node/README.md), [ADR-039](docs/adr/ADR-039-esp32-edge-intelligence.md), [ADR-044](docs/adr/ADR-044-provisioning-tool-enhancements.md), and [Tutorial #34](https://github.com/ruvnet/RuView/issues/34).

<summary><a id="wifi-mat-disaster-response"></a><strong>🚨 WiFi-Mat: Disaster Response</strong> — Search & rescue, START triage, 3D localization</summary>

WiFi signals penetrate non-metallic debris (concrete, wood, drywall) where cameras and thermal sensors cannot reach. The WiFi-Mat module (`wifi-densepose-mat`, 139 tests) uses CSI analysis to detect survivors trapped under rubble, classify their condition using the START triage protocol, and estimate their 3D position — giving rescue teams actionable intelligence within seconds of deployment.

| Capability | How It Works | Performance Target |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Breathing Detection** | Bandpass 0.07-1.0 Hz + Fresnel zone modeling detects chest displacement of 5-10mm at 5 GHz | 4-60 BPM, <500ms latency |
| **Heartbeat Detection** | Micro-Doppler shift extraction from fine-grained CSI phase variation | Via ruvector-temporal-tensor |
| **3D Localization** | Multi-AP triangulation + CSI fingerprint matching + depth estimation through rubble layers | 3-5m penetration |
| **START Triage** | Ensemble classifier votes on breathing + movement + vital stability → P1-P4 priority | <1% false negative |
| **Zone Scanning** | 16+ concurrent scan zones with periodic re-scan and audit logging | Full disaster site |

**Triage classification (START protocol compatible):**

| Status | Color | Detection Criteria | Priority |
|--------|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Immediate | Red | Breathing detected, no movement | P1 |
| Delayed | Yellow | Movement + breathing, stable vitals | P2 |
| Minor | Green | Strong movement, responsive patterns | P3 |
| Deceased | Black | No vitals for >30 min continuous scan | P4 |

**Deployment modes:** portable (single TX/RX handheld), distributed (multiple APs around collapse site), drone-mounted (UAV scanning), vehicle-mounted (mobile command post).

```rust
use wifi_densepose_mat::{DisasterResponse, DisasterConfig, DisasterType, ScanZone, ZoneBounds};

let config = DisasterConfig::builder()
    .disaster_type(DisasterType::Earthquake)
    .sensitivity(0.85)
    .max_depth(5.0)
    .build();

let mut response = DisasterResponse::new(config);
response.initialize_event(location, "Building collapse")?;
response.add_zone(ScanZone::new("North Wing", ZoneBounds::rectangle(0.0, 0.0, 30.0, 20.0)))?;
response.start_scanning().await?;
```

**Safety guarantees:** fail-safe defaults (assume life present on ambiguous signals), redundant multi-algorithm voting, complete audit trail, offline-capable (no network required).

<summary><a id="sota-signal-processing"></a><strong>🔬 SOTA Signal Processing (ADR-014)</strong> — 6 research-grade algorithms</summary>

The signal processing layer bridges the gap between raw commodity WiFi hardware output and research-grade sensing accuracy. Each algorithm addresses a specific limitation of naive CSI processing — from hardware-induced phase corruption to environment-dependent multipath interference. All six are implemented in `wifi-densepose-signal/src/` with deterministic tests and no mock data.

| Algorithm | What It Does | Why It Matters | Math | Source |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|------|--------|
| **Conjugate Multiplication** | Multiplies CSI antenna pairs: `H₁[k] × conj(H₂[k])` | Cancels CFO, SFO, and packet detection delay that corrupt raw phase — preserves only environment-caused phase differences | `CSI_ratio[k] = H₁[k] * conj(H₂[k])` | [SpotFi](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2789168.2790124) (SIGCOMM 2015) |
| **Hampel Filter** | Replaces outliers using running median ± scaled MAD | Z-score uses mean/std which are corrupted by the very outliers it detects (masking effect). Hampel uses median/MAD, resisting up to 50% contamination | `σ̂ = 1.4826 × MAD` | Standard DSP; WiGest (2015) |
| **Fresnel Zone Model** | Models signal variation from chest displacement crossing Fresnel zone boundaries | Zero-crossing counting fails in multipath-rich environments. Fresnel predicts *where* breathing should appear based on TX-RX-body geometry | `ΔΦ = 2π × 2Δd / λ`, `A = \|sin(ΔΦ/2)\|` | [FarSense](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3300061.3345431) (MobiCom 2019) |
| **CSI Spectrogram** | Sliding-window FFT (STFT) per subcarrier → 2D time-frequency matrix | Breathing = 0.2-0.4 Hz band, walking = 1-2 Hz, static = noise. 2D structure enables CNN spatial pattern recognition that 1D features miss | `S[t,f] = \|Σₙ x[n] w[n-t] e^{-j2πfn}\|²` | Standard since 2018 |
| **Subcarrier Selection** | Ranks subcarriers by motion sensitivity (variance ratio) and selects top-K | Not all subcarriers respond to motion — some sit in multipath nulls. Selecting the 10-20 most sensitive improves SNR by 6-10 dB | `sensitivity[k] = var_motion / var_static` | [WiDance](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3117811.3117826) (MobiCom 2017) |
| **Body Velocity Profile** | Extracts velocity distribution from Doppler shifts across subcarriers | BVP is domain-independent — same velocity profile regardless of room layout, furniture, or AP placement. Basis for cross-environment recognition | `BVP[v,t] = Σₖ \|STFTₖ[v,t]\|` | [Widar 3.0](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3328916) (MobiSys 2019) |

**Processing pipeline order:** Raw CSI → Conjugate multiplication (phase cleaning) → Hampel filter (outlier removal) → Subcarrier selection (top-K) → CSI spectrogram (time-frequency) → Fresnel model (breathing) + BVP (activity)

<summary><a id="ai-backbone-ruvector"></a><strong>🤖 AI Backbone: RuVector</strong> — Attention, graph algorithms, and edge-AI compression powering the sensing pipeline</summary>

Raw WiFi signals are noisy, redundant, and environment-dependent. [RuVector](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector) is the AI intelligence layer that transforms them into clean, structured input for the DensePose neural network. It uses **attention mechanisms** to learn which signals to trust, **graph algorithms** that automatically discover which WiFi channels are sensitive to body motion, and **compressed representations** that make edge inference possible on an $8 microcontroller.

Without RuVector, WiFi DensePose would need hand-tuned thresholds, brute-force matrix math, and 4x more memory — making real-time edge inference impossible.

The [`wifi-densepose-ruvector`](https://crates.io/crates/wifi-densepose-ruvector) crate ([ADR-017](docs/adr/ADR-017-ruvector-signal-mat-integration.md)) connects all 7 integration points:

| AI Capability | What It Replaces | RuVector Crate | Result |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| **Self-optimizing channel selection** | Hand-tuned thresholds that break when rooms change | `ruvector-mincut` | Graph min-cut adapts to any environment automatically |
| **Attention-based signal cleaning** | Fixed energy cutoffs that miss subtle breathing | `ruvector-attn-mincut` | Learned gating amplifies body signals, suppresses noise |
| **Learned signal fusion** | Simple averaging where one bad channel corrupts all | `ruvector-attention` | Transformer-style attention downweights corrupted channels |
| **Physics-informed localization** | Expensive nonlinear solvers | `ruvector-solver` | Sparse least-squares Fresnel geometry in real-time |
| **O(1) survivor triangulation** | O(N^3) matrix inversion | `ruvector-solver` | Neumann series linearization for instant position updates |
| **75% memory compression** | 13.4 MB breathing buffers that overflow edge devices | `ruvector-temporal-tensor` | Tiered 3-8 bit quantization fits 60s of vitals in 3.4 MB |

<summary><a id="training--fine-tuning"></a><strong>🧬 Training & Fine-Tuning</strong> — MM-Fi/Wi-Pose pre-training, SONA adaptation</summary>

The training pipeline implements 8 phases in pure Rust (7,832 lines, zero external ML dependencies). It trains a graph transformer with cross-attention to map CSI feature matrices to 17 COCO body keypoints and DensePose UV coordinates — following the approach from the CMU "DensePose From WiFi" paper ([arXiv:2301.00250](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00250)). RuVector crates provide the core building blocks: [ruvector-attention](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector/tree/main/crates/ruvector-attention) for cross-attention layers, [ruvector-mincut](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector/tree/main/crates/ruvector-mincut) for multi-person matching, and [ruvector-temporal-tensor](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector/tree/main/crates/ruvector-temporal-tensor) for CSI buffer compression.

**Three-tier data strategy:**

| Tier | Method | Purpose | RuVector Integration |
|------|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **1. Pre-train** | MM-Fi + Wi-Pose public datasets | Cross-environment generalization (multi-subject, multi-room) | `ruvector-temporal-tensor` compresses CSI windows (114→56 subcarrier resampling) |

**SONA (Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture)** — the continuous adaptation system:

| Component | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Micro-LoRA (rank-4)** | Trains small A×B weight deltas instead of full weights | 100x fewer parameters to update → runs on ESP32 |
| **EWC++ (Fisher matrix)** | Penalizes changes to important weights from previous environments | Prevents catastrophic forgetting when moving between rooms |
| **EnvironmentDetector** | Monitors CSI feature drift with 3-sigma threshold | Auto-triggers adaptation when the model is moved to a new space |
| **Best-epoch snapshot** | Saves best validation loss weights, restores before export | Prevents shipping overfit final-epoch parameters |

```bash
# Pre-train on MM-Fi dataset
./target/release/sensing-server --train --dataset data/ --dataset-type mmfi --epochs 100

# Train and export to RVF in one step
./target/release/sensing-server --train --dataset data/ --epochs 100 --save-rvf model.rvf

# Via Docker (no toolchain needed)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/data:/data ruvnet/wifi-densepose:latest \
  --train --dataset /data --epochs 100 --export-rvf /data/model.rvf

<summary><a id="ruv-neural"></a><strong>🧠 rUv Neural</strong> — Brain topology analysis ecosystem for neural decoding and medical sensing</summary>

[**rUv Neural**](v2/crates/ruv-neural/README.md) is a 12-crate Rust ecosystem that extends RuView's signal processing into brain network topology analysis. It transforms neural magnetic field measurements from quantum sensors (NV diamond magnetometers, optically pumped magnetometers) into dynamic connectivity graphs, using minimum cut algorithms to detect cognitive state transitions in real time. The ecosystem includes crates for signal processing (`ruv-neural-signal`), graph construction (`ruv-neural-graph`), HNSW-indexed pattern memory (`ruv-neural-memory`), graph embeddings (`ruv-neural-embed`), cognitive state decoding (`ruv-neural-decoder`), and ESP32/WASM edge targets. Medical and research applications include early neurological disease detection via topology signatures, brain-computer interfaces, clinical neurofeedback, and non-invasive biomedical sensing -- bridging RuView's RF sensing architecture with the emerging field of quantum biomedical diagnostics.

<summary><strong>QEMU Firmware Testing (ADR-061) — 9-Layer Platform</strong></summary>

Test ESP32-S3 firmware without physical hardware using Espressif's QEMU fork. The platform provides 9 layers of testing capability:

| Layer | Capability | Script / Config |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Mock CSI generator (10 physics-based scenarios) | `firmware/esp32-csi-node/main/mock_csi.c` |
| 2 | Single-node QEMU runner + UART validation (16 checks) | `scripts/qemu-esp32s3-test.sh`, `scripts/validate_qemu_output.py` |
| 3 | Multi-node TDM mesh simulation (TAP networking) | `scripts/qemu-mesh-test.sh`, `scripts/validate_mesh_test.py` |
| 4 | GDB remote debugging (VS Code integration) | `.vscode/launch.json` |
| 5 | Code coverage (gcov/lcov via apptrace) | `firmware/esp32-csi-node/sdkconfig.coverage` |
| 6 | Fuzz testing (libFuzzer + ASAN/UBSAN) | `firmware/esp32-csi-node/test/fuzz_*.c` |
| 7 | NVS provisioning matrix (14 configs) | `scripts/generate_nvs_matrix.py` |
| 8 | Snapshot regression (sub-second VM restore) | `scripts/qemu-snapshot-test.sh` |
| 9 | Chaos testing (fault injection + health monitoring) | `scripts/qemu-chaos-test.sh`, `scripts/inject_fault.py`, `scripts/check_health.py` |

```bash
# Quick start: build + run + validate
cd firmware/esp32-csi-node
idf.py -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.qemu" build

# Single-node test (builds, merges flash, runs QEMU, validates output)
bash scripts/qemu-esp32s3-test.sh

# Multi-node mesh test (3 QEMU instances with TDM)
sudo bash scripts/qemu-mesh-test.sh 3

# Fuzz testing (60 seconds per target)
cd firmware/esp32-csi-node/test && make all CC=clang && make run_serialize FUZZ_DURATION=60

# Chaos testing (fault injection resilience)
bash scripts/qemu-chaos-test.sh --faults all --duration 120
```

**10 test scenarios**: empty room, static person, walking, fall, multi-person, channel sweep, MAC filter, ring overflow, boundary RSSI, zero-length frames.

**14 NVS configs**: default, WiFi-only, full ADR-060, edge tiers 0/1/2, TDM mesh, WASM signed/unsigned, 5GHz, boundary max/min, power-save, empty-strings.

**CI**: GitHub Actions workflow runs 7 NVS matrix configs, 3 fuzz targets, and NVS binary validation on every push to `firmware/`.

See [ADR-061](docs/adr/ADR-061-qemu-esp32s3-firmware-testing.md) for the full architecture.

<details>
<summary><strong>QEMU Swarm Configurator (ADR-062)</strong></summary>

Test multiple ESP32-S3 nodes simultaneously using a YAML-driven orchestrator. Define node roles, network topologies, and validation assertions in a config file.

```bash
# Quick smoke test (2 nodes, 15 seconds)
python3 scripts/qemu_swarm.py --preset smoke

# Standard 3-node test (coordinator + 2 sensors)
python3 scripts/qemu_swarm.py --preset standard

# See all presets
python3 scripts/qemu_swarm.py --list-presets

# Preview without running
python3 scripts/qemu_swarm.py --preset standard --dry-run
```

**Topologies**: star (sensors → coordinator), mesh (fully connected), line (relay chain), ring (circular).

**Node roles**: sensor (generates CSI), coordinator (aggregates), gateway (bridges to host).

**7 presets**: smoke, standard, ci-matrix, large-mesh, line-relay, ring-fault, heterogeneous.

**9 swarm assertions**: boot check, crash detection, TDM collision, frame production, coordinator reception, fall detection, frame rate, boot time, heap health.

See [ADR-062](docs/adr/ADR-062-qemu-swarm-configurator.md) and the [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md#testing-firmware-without-hardware-qemu) for step-by-step instructions.
