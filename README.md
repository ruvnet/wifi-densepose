**See through walls with WiFi.** No cameras. No wearables. No Internet. Just radio waves.

WiFi DensePose turns commodity WiFi signals into real-time human pose estimation, vital sign monitoring, and presence detection — all without a single pixel of video. By analyzing Channel State Information (CSI) disturbances caused by human movement, the system reconstructs body position, breathing rate, and heartbeat using physics-based signal processing and machine learning. [Edge modules](#edge-intelligence-adr-041) are small programs that run directly on the ESP32 sensor — no internet needed, no cloud fees, instant response.

> [!NOTE]
> **CSI-capable hardware required.** Pose estimation, vital signs, and through-wall sensing rely on Channel State Information (CSI) — per-subcarrier amplitude and phase data that standard consumer WiFi does not expose. You need CSI-capable hardware (ESP32-S3 or a research NIC) for full functionality. Consumer WiFi laptops can only provide RSSI-based presence detection, which is significantly less capable.

> **Hardware options** for live CSI capture:
>
> | Option | Hardware | Cost | Full CSI | Capabilities |
> |--------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
> | **ESP32 Mesh** (recommended) | 3-6x ESP32-S3 + WiFi router | ~$54 | Yes | Pose, breathing, heartbeat, motion, presence |
> | **Research NIC** | Intel 5300 / Atheros AR9580 | ~$50-100 | Yes | Full CSI with 3x3 MIMO |
> | **Any WiFi** | Windows, macOS, or Linux laptop | $0 | No | RSSI-only: coarse presence and motion |
>
> No hardware? Verify the signal processing pipeline with the deterministic reference signal: `python v1/data/proof/verify.py`

## 🚀 Key Features

### Sensing

See people, breathing, and heartbeats through walls — using only WiFi signals already in the room.

| | Feature | What It Means |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 🔒 | **Privacy-First** | Tracks human pose using only WiFi signals — no cameras, no video, no images stored |
| 💓 | **Vital Signs** | Detects breathing rate (6-30 breaths/min) and heart rate (40-120 bpm) without any wearable |
| 👥 | **Multi-Person** | Tracks multiple people simultaneously, each with independent pose and vitals — no hard software limit (physics: ~3-5 per AP with 56 subcarriers, more with multi-AP) |
| 🧱 | **Through-Wall** | WiFi passes through walls, furniture, and debris — works where cameras cannot |
| 🚑 | **Disaster Response** | Detects trapped survivors through rubble and classifies injury severity (START triage) |
| 📡 | **Multistatic Mesh** | 4-6 low-cost sensor nodes work together, combining 12+ overlapping signal paths for full 360-degree room coverage with sub-inch accuracy and no person mix-ups ([ADR-029](docs/adr/ADR-029-ruvsense-multistatic-sensing-mode.md)) |
| 🌐 | **Persistent Field Model** | The system learns the RF signature of each room — then subtracts the room to isolate human motion, detect drift over days, predict intent before movement starts, and flag spoofing attempts ([ADR-030](docs/adr/ADR-030-ruvsense-persistent-field-model.md)) |

### Intelligence

The system learns on its own and gets smarter over time — no hand-tuning, no labeled data required.

| | Feature | What It Means |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 🧠 | **Self-Learning** | Teaches itself from raw WiFi data — no labeled training sets, no cameras needed to bootstrap ([ADR-024](docs/adr/ADR-024-contrastive-csi-embedding-model.md)) |
| 🎯 | **AI Signal Processing** | Attention networks, graph algorithms, and smart compression replace hand-tuned thresholds — adapts to each room automatically ([RuVector](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector)) |
| 🌍 | **Works Everywhere** | Train once, deploy in any room — adversarial domain generalization strips environment bias so models transfer across rooms, buildings, and hardware ([ADR-027](docs/adr/ADR-027-cross-environment-domain-generalization.md)) |
| 👁️ | **Cross-Viewpoint Fusion** | AI combines what each sensor sees from its own angle — fills in blind spots and depth ambiguity that no single viewpoint can resolve on its own ([ADR-031](docs/adr/ADR-031-ruview-sensing-first-rf-mode.md)) |
| 🔮 | **Signal-Line Protocol** | A 6-stage processing pipeline transforms raw WiFi signals into structured body representations — from signal cleanup through graph-based spatial reasoning to final pose output ([ADR-033](docs/adr/ADR-033-crv-signal-line-sensing-integration.md)) |
| 🔒 | **QUIC Mesh Security** | All sensor-to-sensor communication is encrypted end-to-end with tamper detection, replay protection, and seamless reconnection if a node moves or drops offline ([ADR-032](docs/adr/ADR-032-multistatic-mesh-security-hardening.md)) |

### Performance & Deployment

Fast enough for real-time use, small enough for edge devices, simple enough for one-command setup.

| | Feature | What It Means |
|---|---------|---------------|
| ⚡ | **Real-Time** | Analyzes WiFi signals in under 100 microseconds per frame — fast enough for live monitoring |
| 🦀 | **810x Faster** | Complete Rust rewrite: 54,000 frames/sec pipeline, 132 MB Docker image, 1,031+ tests |
| 🐳 | **One-Command Setup** | `docker pull ruvnet/wifi-densepose:latest` — live sensing in 30 seconds, no toolchain needed |
| 📡 | **Fully Local** | Runs completely on a $9 ESP32 — no internet connection, no cloud account, no recurring fees. Detects presence, vital signs, and falls on-device with instant response |
| 📦 | **Portable Models** | Trained models package into a single `.rvf` file — runs on edge, cloud, or browser (WASM) |

---

## 🔬 How It Works

WiFi routers flood every room with radio waves. When a person moves — or even breathes — those waves scatter differently. WiFi DensePose reads that scattering pattern and reconstructs what happened:

```
WiFi Router → radio waves pass through room → hit human body → scatter
    ↓
ESP32 mesh (4-6 nodes) captures CSI on channels 1/6/11 via TDM protocol
    ↓
Multi-Band Fusion: 3 channels × 56 subcarriers = 168 virtual subcarriers per link
    ↓
Multistatic Fusion: N×(N-1) links → attention-weighted cross-viewpoint embedding
    ↓
Coherence Gate: accept/reject measurements → stable for days without tuning
    ↓
Signal Processing: Hampel, SpotFi, Fresnel, BVP, spectrogram → clean features
    ↓
AI Backbone (RuVector): attention, graph algorithms, compression, field model
    ↓
Signal-Line Protocol (CRV): 6-stage gestalt → sensory → topology → coherence → search → model
    ↓
Neural Network: processed signals → 17 body keypoints + vital signs + room model
    ↓
Output: real-time pose, breathing, heart rate, room fingerprint, drift alerts
```

No training cameras required — the [Self-Learning system (ADR-024)](docs/adr/ADR-024-contrastive-csi-embedding-model.md) bootstraps from raw WiFi data alone. [MERIDIAN (ADR-027)](docs/adr/ADR-027-cross-environment-domain-generalization.md) ensures the model works in any room, not just the one it trained in.

## 🏢 Use Cases & Applications

WiFi sensing works anywhere WiFi exists. No new hardware in most cases — just software on existing access points or a $8 ESP32 add-on. Because there are no cameras, deployments avoid privacy regulations (GDPR video, HIPAA imaging) by design.

**Scaling:** Each AP distinguishes ~3-5 people (56 subcarriers). Multi-AP multiplies linearly — a 4-AP retail mesh covers ~15-20 occupants. No hard software limit; the practical ceiling is signal physics.

| | Why WiFi sensing wins | Traditional alternative |
|---|----------------------|----------------------|
| 🔒 | **No video, no GDPR/HIPAA imaging rules** | Cameras require consent, signage, data retention policies |
| 🧱 | **Works through walls, shelving, debris** | Cameras need line-of-sight per room |
| 🌙 | **Works in total darkness** | Cameras need IR or visible light |
| 💰 | **$0-$8 per zone** (existing WiFi or ESP32) | Camera systems: $200-$2,000 per zone |
| 🔌 | **WiFi already deployed everywhere** | PIR/radar sensors require new wiring per room |

### Edge Intelligence ([ADR-041](docs/adr/ADR-041-wasm-module-collection.md))

Small programs that run directly on the ESP32 sensor — no internet needed, no cloud fees, instant response. Each module is a tiny WASM file (5-30 KB) that you upload to the device over-the-air. It reads WiFi signal data and makes decisions locally in under 10 ms. [ADR-041](docs/adr/ADR-041-wasm-module-collection.md) defines 60 modules across 13 categories — all 60 are implemented with 609 tests passing.

<summary><strong>🧠 Self-Learning WiFi AI (ADR-024)</strong> — Adaptive recognition, self-optimization, and intelligent anomaly detection</summary>

Every WiFi signal that passes through a room creates a unique fingerprint of that space. WiFi-DensePose already reads these fingerprints to track people, but until now it threw away the internal "understanding" after each reading. The Self-Learning WiFi AI captures and preserves that understanding as compact, reusable vectors — and continuously optimizes itself for each new environment.

**What it does in plain terms:**
- Turns any WiFi signal into a 128-number "fingerprint" that uniquely describes what's happening in a room
- Learns entirely on its own from raw WiFi data — no cameras, no labeling, no human supervision needed
- Recognizes rooms, detects intruders, identifies people, and classifies activities using only WiFi
- Runs on an $8 ESP32 chip (the entire model fits in 55 KB of memory)
- Produces both body pose tracking AND environment fingerprints in a single computation

**Key Capabilities**

| What | How it works | Why it matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Self-supervised learning** | The model watches WiFi signals and teaches itself what "similar" and "different" look like, without any human-labeled data | Deploy anywhere — just plug in a WiFi sensor and wait 10 minutes |
| **Room identification** | Each room produces a distinct WiFi fingerprint pattern | Know which room someone is in without GPS or beacons |
| **Anomaly detection** | An unexpected person or event creates a fingerprint that doesn't match anything seen before | Automatic intrusion and fall detection as a free byproduct |
| **Person re-identification** | Each person disturbs WiFi in a slightly different way, creating a personal signature | Track individuals across sessions without cameras |
| **Environment adaptation** | MicroLoRA adapters (1,792 parameters per room) fine-tune the model for each new space | Adapts to a new room with minimal data — 93% less than retraining from scratch |
| **Memory preservation** | EWC++ regularization remembers what was learned during pretraining | Switching to a new task doesn't erase prior knowledge |
| **Hard-negative mining** | Training focuses on the most confusing examples to learn faster | Better accuracy with the same amount of training data |

**Architecture**

```
WiFi Signal [56 channels] → Transformer + Graph Neural Network
                                  ├→ 128-dim environment fingerprint (for search + identification)
                                  └→ 17-joint body pose (for human tracking)
```

**Quick Start**

```bash
# Step 1: Learn from raw WiFi data (no labels needed)
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --pretrain --dataset data/csi/ --pretrain-epochs 50

# Step 2: Fine-tune with pose labels for full capability
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --train --dataset data/mmfi/ --epochs 100 --save-rvf model.rvf

# Step 3: Use the model — extract fingerprints from live WiFi
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --model model.rvf --embed

# Step 4: Search — find similar environments or detect anomalies
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --model model.rvf --build-index env
```

**Training Modes**

| Mode | What you need | What you get |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Self-Supervised | Just raw WiFi data | A model that understands WiFi signal structure |
| Supervised | WiFi data + body pose labels | Full pose tracking + environment fingerprints |
| Cross-Modal | WiFi data + camera footage | Fingerprints aligned with visual understanding |

**Fingerprint Index Types**

| Index | What it stores | Real-world use |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| `env_fingerprint` | Average room fingerprint | "Is this the kitchen or the bedroom?" |
| `activity_pattern` | Activity boundaries | "Is someone cooking, sleeping, or exercising?" |
| `temporal_baseline` | Normal conditions | "Something unusual just happened in this room" |
| `person_track` | Individual movement signatures | "Person A just entered the living room" |

**Model Size**

| Component | Parameters | Memory (on ESP32) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Transformer backbone | ~28,000 | 28 KB |
| Embedding projection head | ~25,000 | 25 KB |
| Per-room MicroLoRA adapter | ~1,800 | 2 KB |
| **Total** | **~55,000** | **55 KB** (of 520 KB available) |

The self-learning system builds on the [AI Backbone (RuVector)](#ai-backbone-ruvector) signal-processing layer — attention, graph algorithms, and compression — adding contrastive learning on top.

<summary><strong>📡 Signal Processing & Sensing</strong> — From raw WiFi frames to vital signs</summary>

The signal processing stack transforms raw WiFi Channel State Information into actionable human sensing data. Starting from 56-192 subcarrier complex values captured at 20 Hz, the pipeline applies research-grade algorithms (SpotFi phase correction, Hampel outlier rejection, Fresnel zone modeling) to extract breathing rate, heart rate, motion level, and multi-person body pose — all in pure Rust with zero external ML dependencies.

<summary><strong>🧠 Models & Training</strong> — DensePose pipeline, RVF containers, SONA adaptation, RuVector integration</summary>

The neural pipeline uses a graph transformer with cross-attention to map CSI feature matrices to 17 COCO body keypoints and DensePose UV coordinates. Models are packaged as single-file `.rvf` containers with progressive loading (Layer A instant, Layer B warm, Layer C full). SONA (Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture) enables continuous on-device adaptation via micro-LoRA + EWC++ without catastrophic forgetting. Signal processing is powered by 5 [RuVector](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector) crates (v2.0.4) with 7 integration points across the Rust workspace, plus 6 additional vendored crates for inference and graph intelligence.

<summary><strong>🌍 Cross-Environment Generalization (ADR-027 — Project MERIDIAN)</strong> — Train once, deploy in any room without retraining</summary>

| What | How it works | Why it matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Gradient Reversal Layer** | An adversarial classifier tries to guess which room the signal came from; the main network is trained to fool it | Forces the model to discard room-specific shortcuts |
| **Geometry Encoder (FiLM)** | Transmitter/receiver positions are Fourier-encoded and injected as scale+shift conditioning on every layer | The model knows *where* the hardware is, so it doesn't need to memorize layout |
| **Hardware Normalizer** | Resamples any chipset's CSI to a canonical 56-subcarrier format with standardized amplitude | Intel 5300 and ESP32 data look identical to the model |
| **Virtual Domain Augmentation** | Generates synthetic environments with random room scale, wall reflections, scatterers, and noise profiles | Training sees 1000s of rooms even with data from just 2-3 |
| **Rapid Adaptation (TTT)** | Contrastive test-time training with LoRA weight generation from a few unlabeled frames | Zero-shot deployment — the model self-tunes on arrival |
| **Cross-Domain Evaluator** | Leave-one-out evaluation across all training environments with per-environment PCK/OKS metrics | Proves generalization, not just memorization |

**Architecture**

```
CSI Frame [any chipset]
    │
    ▼
HardwareNormalizer ──→ canonical 56 subcarriers, N(0,1) amplitude
    │
    ▼
CSI Encoder (existing) ──→ latent features
    │
    ├──→ Pose Head ──→ 17-joint pose (environment-invariant)
    │
    ├──→ Gradient Reversal Layer ──→ Domain Classifier (adversarial)
    │         λ ramps 0→1 via cosine/exponential schedule
    │
    └──→ Geometry Encoder ──→ FiLM conditioning (scale + shift)
              Fourier positional encoding → DeepSets → per-layer modulation
```

**Security hardening:**
- Bounded calibration buffer (max 10,000 frames) prevents memory exhaustion
- `adapt()` returns `Result<_, AdaptError>` — no panics on bad input
- Atomic instance counter ensures unique weight initialization across threads
- Division-by-zero guards on all augmentation parameters

<summary><strong>📡 Multistatic Sensing (ADR-029/030/031 — Project RuvSense + RuView)</strong> — Multiple ESP32 nodes fuse viewpoints for production-grade pose, tracking, and exotic sensing</summary>

A single WiFi receiver can track people, but has blind spots — limbs behind the torso are invisible, depth is ambiguous, and two people at similar range create overlapping signals. RuvSense solves this by coordinating multiple ESP32 nodes into a **multistatic mesh** where every node acts as both transmitter and receiver, creating N×(N-1) measurement links from N devices.

**What it does in plain terms:**
- 4 ESP32-S3 nodes ($48 total) provide 12 TX-RX measurement links covering 360 degrees
- Each node hops across WiFi channels 1/6/11, tripling effective bandwidth from 20→60 MHz
- Coherence gating rejects noisy frames automatically — no manual tuning, stable for days
- Two-person tracking at 20 Hz with zero identity swaps over 10 minutes
- The room itself becomes a persistent model — the system remembers, predicts, and explains

**Three ADRs, one pipeline:**

<summary><b>🔮 Signal-Line Protocol (CRV)</b></summary>

### 6-Stage CSI Signal Line

Maps the CRV (Coordinate Remote Viewing) signal-line methodology to WiFi CSI processing via `ruvector-crv`:

| Stage | CRV Name | WiFi CSI Mapping | ruvector Component |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| I | Ideograms | Raw CSI gestalt (manmade/natural/movement/energy) | Poincare ball hyperbolic embeddings |
| II | Sensory | Amplitude textures, phase patterns, frequency colors | Multi-head attention vectors |
| III | Dimensional | AP mesh spatial topology, node geometry | GNN graph topology |
| IV | Emotional/AOL | Coherence gating — signal vs noise separation | SNN temporal encoding |
| V | Interrogation | Cross-stage probing — query pose against CSI history | Differentiable search |
| VI | 3D Model | Composite person estimation, MinCut partitioning | Graph partitioning |

**Cross-Session Convergence**: When multiple AP clusters observe the same person, CRV convergence analysis finds agreement in their signal embeddings — directly mapping to cross-room identity continuity.

```rust
use wifi_densepose_ruvector::crv::WifiCrvPipeline;

let mut pipeline = WifiCrvPipeline::new(WifiCrvConfig::default());
pipeline.create_session("room-a", "person-001")?;

// Process CSI frames through 6-stage pipeline
let result = pipeline.process_csi_frame("room-a", &amplitudes, &phases)?;
// result.gestalt = Movement, confidence = 0.87
// result.sensory_embedding = [0.12, -0.34, ...]

// Cross-room identity matching via convergence
let convergence = pipeline.find_cross_room_convergence("person-001", 0.75)?;
```

**Architecture**:
- `CsiGestaltClassifier` — Maps CSI amplitude/phase patterns to 6 gestalt types
- `CsiSensoryEncoder` — Extracts texture/color/temperature/luminosity features from subcarriers
- `MeshTopologyEncoder` — Encodes AP mesh as GNN graph (Stage III)
- `CoherenceAolDetector` — Maps coherence gate states to AOL noise detection (Stage IV)
- `WifiCrvPipeline` — Orchestrates all 6 stages into unified sensing session

## 📡 Signal Processing & Sensing

<details>
<summary><a id="esp32-s3-hardware-pipeline"></a><strong>📡 ESP32-S3 Hardware Pipeline (ADR-018)</strong> — 28 Hz CSI streaming, flash & provision</summary>

A single ESP32-S3 board (~$9) captures WiFi signal data 28 times per second and streams it over UDP. A host server can visualize and record the data, but the ESP32 can also run on its own — detecting presence, measuring breathing and heart rate, and alerting on falls without any server at all.

```
ESP32-S3 node                    UDP/5005        Host server (optional)
┌───────────────────────┐      ──────────>      ┌──────────────────────┐

│ 28 Hz, up to 192 sub- │      or 32-byte       │ Visualizes poses     │
│ carriers per frame     │      vitals packets   │ Records CSI data     │

│ On-device (optional):  │                       └──────────────────────┘
│  Presence detection    │
│  Breathing + heart rate│
│  Fall detection        │
│  WASM custom modules   │
└───────────────────────┘
```

| Metric | Measured on hardware |
|--------|----------------------|
| CSI frame rate | 28.5 Hz (channel 5, BW20) |
| Subcarriers per frame | 64 / 128 / 192 (depends on WiFi mode) |
| UDP latency | < 1 ms on local network |
| Presence detection range | Reliable at 3 m through walls |
| Binary size | 947 KB (fits in 1 MB flash partition) |
| Boot to ready | ~3.9 seconds |

### Flash and provision

Download a pre-built binary — no build toolchain needed:

| Release | What's included | Tag |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| [v0.2.0](https://github.com/ruvnet/wifi-densepose/releases/tag/v0.2.0-esp32) | Stable — raw CSI streaming, multi-node TDM, channel hopping | `v0.2.0-esp32` |
| [v0.3.0-alpha](https://github.com/ruvnet/wifi-densepose/releases/tag/v0.3.0-alpha-esp32) | Alpha — adds on-device edge intelligence and WASM modules ([ADR-039](docs/adr/ADR-039-esp32-edge-intelligence.md), [ADR-040](docs/adr/ADR-040-wasm-programmable-sensing.md)) | `v0.3.0-alpha-esp32` |

```bash
# 1. Flash the firmware to your ESP32-S3
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 --port COM7 --baud 460800 \
  write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size 8MB \
  0x0 bootloader.bin 0x8000 partition-table.bin 0x10000 esp32-csi-node.bin

# 2. Set WiFi credentials and server address (stored in flash, survives reboots)
python firmware/esp32-csi-node/provision.py --port COM7 \
  --ssid "YourWiFi" --password "secret" --target-ip 192.168.1.20

# 3. (Optional) Start the host server to visualize data
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --http-port 3000 --source auto
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Multi-node mesh

For better accuracy and room coverage, deploy 3-6 nodes with time-division multiplexing (TDM) so they take turns transmitting:

```bash
# Node 0 of a 3-node mesh
python firmware/esp32-csi-node/provision.py --port COM7 \
  --ssid "YourWiFi" --password "secret" --target-ip 192.168.1.20 \
  --node-id 0 --tdm-slot 0 --tdm-total 3

# Node 1
python firmware/esp32-csi-node/provision.py --port COM8 \
  --ssid "YourWiFi" --password "secret" --target-ip 192.168.1.20 \
  --node-id 1 --tdm-slot 1 --tdm-total 3
```

Nodes can also hop across WiFi channels (1, 6, 11) to increase sensing bandwidth — configured via [ADR-029](docs/adr/ADR-029-ruvsense-multistatic-sensing-mode.md) channel hopping.

### On-device intelligence (v0.3.0-alpha)

The alpha firmware can analyze signals locally and send compact results instead of raw data. This means the ESP32 works standalone — no server needed for basic sensing. Disabled by default for backward compatibility.

| Tier | What it does | RAM used |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **0** | Off — streams raw CSI only (same as v0.2.0) | 0 KB |
| **1** | Cleans up signals, picks the best subcarriers, compresses data (saves 30-50% bandwidth) | ~30 KB |
| **2** | Everything in Tier 1 + detects presence, measures breathing and heart rate, detects falls | ~33 KB |
| **3** | Everything in Tier 2 + runs custom WASM modules (gesture recognition, intrusion detection, and [63 more](docs/edge-modules/README.md)) | ~160 KB/module |

Enable without reflashing — just reprovision:

```bash
# Turn on Tier 2 (vitals) on an already-flashed node
python firmware/esp32-csi-node/provision.py --port COM7 \
  --ssid "YourWiFi" --password "secret" --target-ip 192.168.1.20 \
  --edge-tier 2

# Fine-tune detection thresholds
python firmware/esp32-csi-node/provision.py --port COM7 \
  --edge-tier 2 --vital-int 500 --fall-thresh 5000 --subk-count 16
```

When Tier 2 is active, the node sends a 32-byte vitals packet once per second containing: presence, motion level, breathing BPM, heart rate BPM, confidence scores, fall alert flag, and occupancy count.

See [firmware/esp32-csi-node/README.md](firmware/esp32-csi-node/README.md), [ADR-039](docs/adr/ADR-039-esp32-edge-intelligence.md), [ADR-044](docs/adr/ADR-044-provisioning-tool-enhancements.md), and [Tutorial #34](https://github.com/ruvnet/wifi-densepose/issues/34).

<summary><a id="wifi-mat-disaster-response"></a><strong>🚨 WiFi-Mat: Disaster Response</strong> — Search & rescue, START triage, 3D localization</summary>

WiFi signals penetrate non-metallic debris (concrete, wood, drywall) where cameras and thermal sensors cannot reach. The WiFi-Mat module (`wifi-densepose-mat`, 139 tests) uses CSI analysis to detect survivors trapped under rubble, classify their condition using the START triage protocol, and estimate their 3D position — giving rescue teams actionable intelligence within seconds of deployment.

| Capability | How It Works | Performance Target |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Breathing Detection** | Bandpass 0.07-1.0 Hz + Fresnel zone modeling detects chest displacement of 5-10mm at 5 GHz | 4-60 BPM, <500ms latency |
| **Heartbeat Detection** | Micro-Doppler shift extraction from fine-grained CSI phase variation | Via ruvector-temporal-tensor |
| **3D Localization** | Multi-AP triangulation + CSI fingerprint matching + depth estimation through rubble layers | 3-5m penetration |
| **START Triage** | Ensemble classifier votes on breathing + movement + vital stability → P1-P4 priority | <1% false negative |
| **Zone Scanning** | 16+ concurrent scan zones with periodic re-scan and audit logging | Full disaster site |

**Triage classification (START protocol compatible):**

| Status | Color | Detection Criteria | Priority |
|--------|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Immediate | Red | Breathing detected, no movement | P1 |
| Delayed | Yellow | Movement + breathing, stable vitals | P2 |
| Minor | Green | Strong movement, responsive patterns | P3 |
| Deceased | Black | No vitals for >30 min continuous scan | P4 |

**Deployment modes:** portable (single TX/RX handheld), distributed (multiple APs around collapse site), drone-mounted (UAV scanning), vehicle-mounted (mobile command post).

```rust
use wifi_densepose_mat::{DisasterResponse, DisasterConfig, DisasterType, ScanZone, ZoneBounds};

let config = DisasterConfig::builder()
    .disaster_type(DisasterType::Earthquake)
    .sensitivity(0.85)
    .max_depth(5.0)
    .build();

let mut response = DisasterResponse::new(config);
response.initialize_event(location, "Building collapse")?;
response.add_zone(ScanZone::new("North Wing", ZoneBounds::rectangle(0.0, 0.0, 30.0, 20.0)))?;
response.start_scanning().await?;
```

**Safety guarantees:** fail-safe defaults (assume life present on ambiguous signals), redundant multi-algorithm voting, complete audit trail, offline-capable (no network required).

<summary><a id="sota-signal-processing"></a><strong>🔬 SOTA Signal Processing (ADR-014)</strong> — 6 research-grade algorithms</summary>

The signal processing layer bridges the gap between raw commodity WiFi hardware output and research-grade sensing accuracy. Each algorithm addresses a specific limitation of naive CSI processing — from hardware-induced phase corruption to environment-dependent multipath interference. All six are implemented in `wifi-densepose-signal/src/` with deterministic tests and no mock data.

| Algorithm | What It Does | Why It Matters | Math | Source |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|------|--------|
| **Conjugate Multiplication** | Multiplies CSI antenna pairs: `H₁[k] × conj(H₂[k])` | Cancels CFO, SFO, and packet detection delay that corrupt raw phase — preserves only environment-caused phase differences | `CSI_ratio[k] = H₁[k] * conj(H₂[k])` | [SpotFi](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2789168.2790124) (SIGCOMM 2015) |
| **Hampel Filter** | Replaces outliers using running median ± scaled MAD | Z-score uses mean/std which are corrupted by the very outliers it detects (masking effect). Hampel uses median/MAD, resisting up to 50% contamination | `σ̂ = 1.4826 × MAD` | Standard DSP; WiGest (2015) |
| **Fresnel Zone Model** | Models signal variation from chest displacement crossing Fresnel zone boundaries | Zero-crossing counting fails in multipath-rich environments. Fresnel predicts *where* breathing should appear based on TX-RX-body geometry | `ΔΦ = 2π × 2Δd / λ`, `A = \|sin(ΔΦ/2)\|` | [FarSense](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3300061.3345431) (MobiCom 2019) |
| **CSI Spectrogram** | Sliding-window FFT (STFT) per subcarrier → 2D time-frequency matrix | Breathing = 0.2-0.4 Hz band, walking = 1-2 Hz, static = noise. 2D structure enables CNN spatial pattern recognition that 1D features miss | `S[t,f] = \|Σₙ x[n] w[n-t] e^{-j2πfn}\|²` | Standard since 2018 |
| **Subcarrier Selection** | Ranks subcarriers by motion sensitivity (variance ratio) and selects top-K | Not all subcarriers respond to motion — some sit in multipath nulls. Selecting the 10-20 most sensitive improves SNR by 6-10 dB | `sensitivity[k] = var_motion / var_static` | [WiDance](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3117811.3117826) (MobiCom 2017) |
| **Body Velocity Profile** | Extracts velocity distribution from Doppler shifts across subcarriers | BVP is domain-independent — same velocity profile regardless of room layout, furniture, or AP placement. Basis for cross-environment recognition | `BVP[v,t] = Σₖ \|STFTₖ[v,t]\|` | [Widar 3.0](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3328916) (MobiSys 2019) |

**Processing pipeline order:** Raw CSI → Conjugate multiplication (phase cleaning) → Hampel filter (outlier removal) → Subcarrier selection (top-K) → CSI spectrogram (time-frequency) → Fresnel model (breathing) + BVP (activity)

<summary><a id="ai-backbone-ruvector"></a><strong>🤖 AI Backbone: RuVector</strong> — Attention, graph algorithms, and edge-AI compression powering the sensing pipeline</summary>

Raw WiFi signals are noisy, redundant, and environment-dependent. [RuVector](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector) is the AI intelligence layer that transforms them into clean, structured input for the DensePose neural network. It uses **attention mechanisms** to learn which signals to trust, **graph algorithms** that automatically discover which WiFi channels are sensitive to body motion, and **compressed representations** that make edge inference possible on an $8 microcontroller.

Without RuVector, WiFi DensePose would need hand-tuned thresholds, brute-force matrix math, and 4x more memory — making real-time edge inference impossible.

The [`wifi-densepose-ruvector`](https://crates.io/crates/wifi-densepose-ruvector) crate ([ADR-017](docs/adr/ADR-017-ruvector-signal-mat-integration.md)) connects all 7 integration points:

| AI Capability | What It Replaces | RuVector Crate | Result |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| **Self-optimizing channel selection** | Hand-tuned thresholds that break when rooms change | `ruvector-mincut` | Graph min-cut adapts to any environment automatically |
| **Attention-based signal cleaning** | Fixed energy cutoffs that miss subtle breathing | `ruvector-attn-mincut` | Learned gating amplifies body signals, suppresses noise |
| **Learned signal fusion** | Simple averaging where one bad channel corrupts all | `ruvector-attention` | Transformer-style attention downweights corrupted channels |
| **Physics-informed localization** | Expensive nonlinear solvers | `ruvector-solver` | Sparse least-squares Fresnel geometry in real-time |
| **O(1) survivor triangulation** | O(N^3) matrix inversion | `ruvector-solver` | Neumann series linearization for instant position updates |
| **75% memory compression** | 13.4 MB breathing buffers that overflow edge devices | `ruvector-temporal-tensor` | Tiered 3-8 bit quantization fits 60s of vitals in 3.4 MB |

<summary><a id="training--fine-tuning"></a><strong>🧬 Training & Fine-Tuning</strong> — MM-Fi/Wi-Pose pre-training, SONA adaptation</summary>

The training pipeline implements 8 phases in pure Rust (7,832 lines, zero external ML dependencies). It trains a graph transformer with cross-attention to map CSI feature matrices to 17 COCO body keypoints and DensePose UV coordinates — following the approach from the CMU "DensePose From WiFi" paper ([arXiv:2301.00250](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00250)). RuVector crates provide the core building blocks: [ruvector-attention](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector/tree/main/crates/ruvector-attention) for cross-attention layers, [ruvector-mincut](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector/tree/main/crates/ruvector-mincut) for multi-person matching, and [ruvector-temporal-tensor](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector/tree/main/crates/ruvector-temporal-tensor) for CSI buffer compression.

**Three-tier data strategy:**

| Tier | Method | Purpose | RuVector Integration |
|------|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **1. Pre-train** | MM-Fi + Wi-Pose public datasets | Cross-environment generalization (multi-subject, multi-room) | `ruvector-temporal-tensor` compresses CSI windows (114→56 subcarrier resampling) |
| **2. Fine-tune** | ESP32 CSI + camera pseudo-labels | Environment-specific multipath adaptation | `ruvector-solver` for Fresnel geometry, `ruvector-attn-mincut` for subcarrier gating |
| **3. SONA adapt** | Micro-LoRA (rank-4) + EWC++ | Continuous on-device learning without catastrophic forgetting | [SONA](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector/tree/main/crates/sona) architecture (Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture) |

| 8 | `main.rs` integration | `--train`, `--model`, `--progressive` CLI flags, REST endpoints | — |

**SONA (Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture)** — the continuous adaptation system:

| Component | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Micro-LoRA (rank-4)** | Trains small A×B weight deltas instead of full weights | 100x fewer parameters to update → runs on ESP32 |
| **EWC++ (Fisher matrix)** | Penalizes changes to important weights from previous environments | Prevents catastrophic forgetting when moving between rooms |
| **EnvironmentDetector** | Monitors CSI feature drift with 3-sigma threshold | Auto-triggers adaptation when the model is moved to a new space |
| **Best-epoch snapshot** | Saves best validation loss weights, restores before export | Prevents shipping overfit final-epoch parameters |

```bash
# Pre-train on MM-Fi dataset
./target/release/sensing-server --train --dataset data/ --dataset-type mmfi --epochs 100

# Train and export to RVF in one step
./target/release/sensing-server --train --dataset data/ --epochs 100 --save-rvf model.rvf

# Via Docker (no toolchain needed)
