# Architecture Decision Records

This folder contains 44 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document every significant technical choice in the RuView / WiFi-DensePose project.

## Why ADRs?

Building a system that turns WiFi signals into human pose estimation involves hundreds of non-obvious decisions: which signal processing algorithms to use, how to bridge ESP32 firmware to a Rust pipeline, whether to run inference on-device or on a server, how to handle multi-person separation with limited subcarriers.

ADRs capture the **context**, **options considered**, **decision made**, and **consequences** for each of these choices. They serve three purposes:

1. **Institutional memory** — Six months from now, anyone (human or AI) can read *why* we chose IIR bandpass filters over FIR for vital sign extraction, not just see the code.

2. **AI-assisted development** — When an AI agent works on this codebase, ADRs give it the constraints and rationale it needs to make changes that align with the existing architecture. Without them, AI-generated code tends to drift — reinventing patterns that already exist, contradicting earlier decisions, or optimizing for the wrong tradeoffs.

3. **Review checkpoints** — Each ADR is a reviewable artifact. When a proposed change touches the architecture, the ADR forces the author to articulate tradeoffs *before* writing code, not after.

### ADRs and Domain-Driven Design

The project uses [Domain-Driven Design](../ddd/) (DDD) to organize code into bounded contexts — each with its own language, types, and responsibilities. ADRs and DDD work together:

- **ADRs define boundaries**: ADR-029 (RuvSense) established multistatic sensing as a separate bounded context from single-node CSI. ADR-042 (CHCI) defined a new aggregate root for coherent channel imaging.
- **DDD models define the language**: The [RuvSense domain model](../ddd/ruvsense-domain-model.md) defines terms like "coherence gate", "dwell time", and "TDM slot" that ADRs reference precisely.
- **Together they prevent drift**: An AI agent reading ADR-039 knows that edge processing tiers are configured via NVS keys, not compile-time flags — because the ADR says so. The DDD model tells it which aggregate owns that configuration.

### How ADRs are structured

Each ADR follows a consistent format:

- **Context** — What problem or gap prompted this decision
- **Decision** — What we chose to do and how
- **Consequences** — What improved, what got harder, and what risks remain
- **References** — Related ADRs, papers, and code paths

Statuses: **Proposed** (under discussion), **Accepted** (approved and/or implemented), **Superseded** (replaced by a later ADR).
