# WiFi DensePose

**See through walls with WiFi.** No cameras. No wearables. Just radio waves.

WiFi DensePose turns commodity WiFi signals into real-time human pose estimation, vital sign monitoring, and presence detection — all without a single pixel of video. By analyzing Channel State Information (CSI) disturbances caused by human movement, the system reconstructs body position, breathing rate, and heartbeat using physics-based signal processing and machine learning.

> | What | How | Speed |
> |------|-----|-------|
> | **Pose estimation** | CSI subcarrier amplitude/phase → DensePose UV maps | 54K fps (Rust) |
> | **Breathing detection** | Bandpass 0.1-0.5 Hz → FFT peak | 6-30 BPM |
> | **Heart rate** | Bandpass 0.8-2.0 Hz → FFT peak | 40-120 BPM |
> | **Presence sensing** | RSSI variance + motion band power | < 1ms latency |
> | **Through-wall** | Fresnel zone geometry + multipath modeling | Up to 5m depth |

```bash
# 30 seconds to live sensing — no toolchain required
docker pull ruvnet/wifi-densepose:latest
docker run -p 3000:3000 ruvnet/wifi-densepose:latest
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

> [!NOTE]
> **CSI-capable hardware required.** Pose estimation, vital signs, and through-wall sensing rely on Channel State Information (CSI) — per-subcarrier amplitude and phase data that standard consumer WiFi does not expose. You need CSI-capable hardware (ESP32-S3 or a research NIC) for full functionality. Consumer WiFi laptops can only provide RSSI-based presence detection, which is significantly less capable.

> **Hardware options** for live CSI capture:
>
> | Option | Hardware | Cost | Full CSI | Capabilities |
> |--------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
> | **ESP32 Mesh** (recommended) | 3-6x ESP32-S3 + WiFi router | ~$54 | Yes | Pose, breathing, heartbeat, motion, presence |
> | **Research NIC** | Intel 5300 / Atheros AR9580 | ~$50-100 | Yes | Full CSI with 3x3 MIMO |
> | **Any WiFi** | Windows, macOS, or Linux laptop | $0 | No | RSSI-only: coarse presence and motion |
>
> No hardware? Verify the signal processing pipeline with the deterministic reference signal: `python v1/data/proof/verify.py`

## 🏢 Use Cases & Applications

WiFi sensing works anywhere WiFi exists. No new hardware in most cases — just software on existing access points or a $8 ESP32 add-on. Because there are no cameras, deployments avoid privacy regulations (GDPR video, HIPAA imaging) by design.

**Scaling:** Each AP distinguishes ~3-5 people (56 subcarriers). Multi-AP multiplies linearly — a 4-AP retail mesh covers ~15-20 occupants. No hard software limit; the practical ceiling is signal physics.

| | Why WiFi sensing wins | Traditional alternative |
|---|----------------------|----------------------|
| 🔒 | **No video, no GDPR/HIPAA imaging rules** | Cameras require consent, signage, data retention policies |
| 🧱 | **Works through walls, shelving, debris** | Cameras need line-of-sight per room |
| 🌙 | **Works in total darkness** | Cameras need IR or visible light |
| 💰 | **$0-$8 per zone** (existing WiFi or ESP32) | Camera systems: $200-$2,000 per zone |
| 🔌 | **WiFi already deployed everywhere** | PIR/radar sensors require new wiring per room |

<summary><strong>🤖 Robotics & Industrial</strong> — Autonomous systems, manufacturing, android spatial awareness</summary>

WiFi sensing gives robots and autonomous systems a spatial awareness layer that works where LIDAR and cameras fail — through dust, smoke, fog, and around corners. The CSI signal field acts as a "sixth sense" for detecting humans in the environment without requiring line-of-sight.

<summary><strong>🧠 Self-Learning WiFi AI (ADR-024)</strong> — Adaptive recognition, self-optimization, and intelligent anomaly detection</summary>

Every WiFi signal that passes through a room creates a unique fingerprint of that space. WiFi-DensePose already reads these fingerprints to track people, but until now it threw away the internal "understanding" after each reading. The Self-Learning WiFi AI captures and preserves that understanding as compact, reusable vectors — and continuously optimizes itself for each new environment.

**What it does in plain terms:**
- Turns any WiFi signal into a 128-number "fingerprint" that uniquely describes what's happening in a room
- Learns entirely on its own from raw WiFi data — no cameras, no labeling, no human supervision needed
- Recognizes rooms, detects intruders, identifies people, and classifies activities using only WiFi
- Runs on an $8 ESP32 chip (the entire model fits in 60 KB of memory)
- Produces both body pose tracking AND environment fingerprints in a single computation

**Key Capabilities**

| What | How it works | Why it matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Self-supervised learning** | The model watches WiFi signals and teaches itself what "similar" and "different" look like, without any human-labeled data | Deploy anywhere — just plug in a WiFi sensor and wait 10 minutes |
| **Room identification** | Each room produces a distinct WiFi fingerprint pattern | Know which room someone is in without GPS or beacons |
| **Anomaly detection** | An unexpected person or event creates a fingerprint that doesn't match anything seen before | Automatic intrusion and fall detection as a free byproduct |
| **Person re-identification** | Each person disturbs WiFi in a slightly different way, creating a personal signature | Track individuals across sessions without cameras |
| **Environment adaptation** | MicroLoRA adapters (1,792 parameters per room) fine-tune the model for each new space | Adapts to a new room with minimal data — 93% less than retraining from scratch |
| **Memory preservation** | EWC++ regularization remembers what was learned during pretraining | Switching to a new task doesn't erase prior knowledge |
| **Hard-negative mining** | Training focuses on the most confusing examples to learn faster | Better accuracy with the same amount of training data |

**Architecture**

```
WiFi Signal [56 channels] → Transformer + Graph Neural Network
                                  ├→ 128-dim environment fingerprint (for search + identification)
                                  └→ 17-joint body pose (for human tracking)
```

**Quick Start**

```bash
# Step 1: Learn from raw WiFi data (no labels needed)
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --pretrain --dataset data/csi/ --pretrain-epochs 50

# Step 2: Fine-tune with pose labels for full capability
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --train --dataset data/mmfi/ --epochs 100 --save-rvf model.rvf

# Step 3: Use the model — extract fingerprints from live WiFi
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --model model.rvf --embed

# Step 4: Search — find similar environments or detect anomalies
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --model model.rvf --build-index env
```

**Training Modes**

| Mode | What you need | What you get |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Self-Supervised | Just raw WiFi data | A model that understands WiFi signal structure |
| Supervised | WiFi data + body pose labels | Full pose tracking + environment fingerprints |
| Cross-Modal | WiFi data + camera footage | Fingerprints aligned with visual understanding |

**Fingerprint Index Types**

| Index | What it stores | Real-world use |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| `env_fingerprint` | Average room fingerprint | "Is this the kitchen or the bedroom?" |
| `activity_pattern` | Activity boundaries | "Is someone cooking, sleeping, or exercising?" |
| `temporal_baseline` | Normal conditions | "Something unusual just happened in this room" |
| `person_track` | Individual movement signatures | "Person A just entered the living room" |

**Model Size**

| Component | Parameters | Memory (on ESP32) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Transformer backbone | ~28,000 | 28 KB |
| Embedding projection head | ~25,000 | 25 KB |
| Per-room MicroLoRA adapter | ~1,800 | 2 KB |
| **Total** | **~55,000** | **55 KB** (of 520 KB available) |

<summary><strong>🧠 Models & Training</strong> — DensePose pipeline, RVF containers, SONA adaptation, RuVector integration</summary>

The neural pipeline uses a graph transformer with cross-attention to map CSI feature matrices to 17 COCO body keypoints and DensePose UV coordinates. Models are packaged as single-file `.rvf` containers with progressive loading (Layer A instant, Layer B warm, Layer C full). SONA (Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture) enables continuous on-device adaptation via micro-LoRA + EWC++ without catastrophic forgetting. Signal processing is powered by 5 [RuVector](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector) crates (v2.0.4) with 7 integration points across the Rust workspace, plus 6 additional vendored crates for inference and graph intelligence.

<summary><a id="wifi-mat-disaster-response"></a><strong>🚨 WiFi-Mat: Disaster Response</strong> — Search & rescue, START triage, 3D localization</summary>

WiFi signals penetrate non-metallic debris (concrete, wood, drywall) where cameras and thermal sensors cannot reach. The WiFi-Mat module (`wifi-densepose-mat`, 139 tests) uses CSI analysis to detect survivors trapped under rubble, classify their condition using the START triage protocol, and estimate their 3D position — giving rescue teams actionable intelligence within seconds of deployment.

| Capability | How It Works | Performance Target |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Breathing Detection** | Bandpass 0.07-1.0 Hz + Fresnel zone modeling detects chest displacement of 5-10mm at 5 GHz | 4-60 BPM, <500ms latency |
| **Heartbeat Detection** | Micro-Doppler shift extraction from fine-grained CSI phase variation | Via ruvector-temporal-tensor |
| **3D Localization** | Multi-AP triangulation + CSI fingerprint matching + depth estimation through rubble layers | 3-5m penetration |
| **START Triage** | Ensemble classifier votes on breathing + movement + vital stability → P1-P4 priority | <1% false negative |
| **Zone Scanning** | 16+ concurrent scan zones with periodic re-scan and audit logging | Full disaster site |

**Triage classification (START protocol compatible):**

| Status | Color | Detection Criteria | Priority |
|--------|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Immediate | Red | Breathing detected, no movement | P1 |
| Delayed | Yellow | Movement + breathing, stable vitals | P2 |
| Minor | Green | Strong movement, responsive patterns | P3 |
| Deceased | Black | No vitals for >30 min continuous scan | P4 |

**Deployment modes:** portable (single TX/RX handheld), distributed (multiple APs around collapse site), drone-mounted (UAV scanning), vehicle-mounted (mobile command post).

```rust
use wifi_densepose_mat::{DisasterResponse, DisasterConfig, DisasterType, ScanZone, ZoneBounds};

let config = DisasterConfig::builder()
    .disaster_type(DisasterType::Earthquake)
    .sensitivity(0.85)
    .max_depth(5.0)
    .build();

let mut response = DisasterResponse::new(config);
response.initialize_event(location, "Building collapse")?;
response.add_zone(ScanZone::new("North Wing", ZoneBounds::rectangle(0.0, 0.0, 30.0, 20.0)))?;
response.start_scanning().await?;
```

**Safety guarantees:** fail-safe defaults (assume life present on ambiguous signals), redundant multi-algorithm voting, complete audit trail, offline-capable (no network required).

<summary><a id="sota-signal-processing"></a><strong>🔬 SOTA Signal Processing (ADR-014)</strong> — 6 research-grade algorithms</summary>

The signal processing layer bridges the gap between raw commodity WiFi hardware output and research-grade sensing accuracy. Each algorithm addresses a specific limitation of naive CSI processing — from hardware-induced phase corruption to environment-dependent multipath interference. All six are implemented in `wifi-densepose-signal/src/` with deterministic tests and no mock data.

| Algorithm | What It Does | Why It Matters | Math | Source |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|------|--------|
| **Conjugate Multiplication** | Multiplies CSI antenna pairs: `H₁[k] × conj(H₂[k])` | Cancels CFO, SFO, and packet detection delay that corrupt raw phase — preserves only environment-caused phase differences | `CSI_ratio[k] = H₁[k] * conj(H₂[k])` | [SpotFi](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2789168.2790124) (SIGCOMM 2015) |
| **Hampel Filter** | Replaces outliers using running median ± scaled MAD | Z-score uses mean/std which are corrupted by the very outliers it detects (masking effect). Hampel uses median/MAD, resisting up to 50% contamination | `σ̂ = 1.4826 × MAD` | Standard DSP; WiGest (2015) |
| **Fresnel Zone Model** | Models signal variation from chest displacement crossing Fresnel zone boundaries | Zero-crossing counting fails in multipath-rich environments. Fresnel predicts *where* breathing should appear based on TX-RX-body geometry | `ΔΦ = 2π × 2Δd / λ`, `A = \|sin(ΔΦ/2)\|` | [FarSense](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3300061.3345431) (MobiCom 2019) |
| **CSI Spectrogram** | Sliding-window FFT (STFT) per subcarrier → 2D time-frequency matrix | Breathing = 0.2-0.4 Hz band, walking = 1-2 Hz, static = noise. 2D structure enables CNN spatial pattern recognition that 1D features miss | `S[t,f] = \|Σₙ x[n] w[n-t] e^{-j2πfn}\|²` | Standard since 2018 |
| **Subcarrier Selection** | Ranks subcarriers by motion sensitivity (variance ratio) and selects top-K | Not all subcarriers respond to motion — some sit in multipath nulls. Selecting the 10-20 most sensitive improves SNR by 6-10 dB | `sensitivity[k] = var_motion / var_static` | [WiDance](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3117811.3117826) (MobiCom 2017) |
| **Body Velocity Profile** | Extracts velocity distribution from Doppler shifts across subcarriers | BVP is domain-independent — same velocity profile regardless of room layout, furniture, or AP placement. Basis for cross-environment recognition | `BVP[v,t] = Σₖ \|STFTₖ[v,t]\|` | [Widar 3.0](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3328916) (MobiSys 2019) |

**Processing pipeline order:** Raw CSI → Conjugate multiplication (phase cleaning) → Hampel filter (outlier removal) → Subcarrier selection (top-K) → CSI spectrogram (time-frequency) → Fresnel model (breathing) + BVP (activity)

<summary><a id="training--fine-tuning"></a><strong>🧬 Training & Fine-Tuning</strong> — MM-Fi/Wi-Pose pre-training, SONA adaptation</summary>

The training pipeline implements 8 phases in pure Rust (7,832 lines, zero external ML dependencies). It trains a graph transformer with cross-attention to map CSI feature matrices to 17 COCO body keypoints and DensePose UV coordinates — following the approach from the CMU "DensePose From WiFi" paper ([arXiv:2301.00250](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00250)). RuVector crates provide the core building blocks: [ruvector-attention](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector/tree/main/crates/ruvector-attention) for cross-attention layers, [ruvector-mincut](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector/tree/main/crates/ruvector-mincut) for multi-person matching, and [ruvector-temporal-tensor](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector/tree/main/crates/ruvector-temporal-tensor) for CSI buffer compression.

**Three-tier data strategy:**

| Tier | Method | Purpose | RuVector Integration |
|------|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **1. Pre-train** | MM-Fi + Wi-Pose public datasets | Cross-environment generalization (multi-subject, multi-room) | `ruvector-temporal-tensor` compresses CSI windows (114→56 subcarrier resampling) |
| **2. Fine-tune** | ESP32 CSI + camera pseudo-labels | Environment-specific multipath adaptation | `ruvector-solver` for Fresnel geometry, `ruvector-attn-mincut` for subcarrier gating |
| **3. SONA adapt** | Micro-LoRA (rank-4) + EWC++ | Continuous on-device learning without catastrophic forgetting | [SONA](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector/tree/main/crates/sona) architecture (Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture) |

**SONA (Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture)** — the continuous adaptation system:

| Component | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Micro-LoRA (rank-4)** | Trains small A×B weight deltas instead of full weights | 100x fewer parameters to update → runs on ESP32 |
| **EWC++ (Fisher matrix)** | Penalizes changes to important weights from previous environments | Prevents catastrophic forgetting when moving between rooms |
| **EnvironmentDetector** | Monitors CSI feature drift with 3-sigma threshold | Auto-triggers adaptation when the model is moved to a new space |
| **Best-epoch snapshot** | Saves best validation loss weights, restores before export | Prevents shipping overfit final-epoch parameters |

```bash
# Pre-train on MM-Fi dataset
./target/release/sensing-server --train --dataset data/ --dataset-type mmfi --epochs 100

# Train and export to RVF in one step
./target/release/sensing-server --train --dataset data/ --epochs 100 --save-rvf model.rvf
